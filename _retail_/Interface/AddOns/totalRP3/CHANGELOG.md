# Changelog version 1.6.6

## Added

- Added slash commands to change your roleplay status, which you can use in macros. You can now use `/trp3 status ic` to get in character, `/trp3 status ooc` to get out of character, or `/trp3 status toggle` to switch status.
- Added a chat setting to display the OOC indicator next to the name in chat.
- Added a setting to hide the map scan button if no scan is available.
- Added a roleplay language field to the main dashboard.
  - This setting is profile-based, defaults to your addon language, and allows you to indicate the language you're roleplaying in.
  - If your addon language doesn't match a player's roleplaying language, you'll see a flag at the bottom of their tooltip indicating their roleplaying language.
  - This change is mainly aimed at Classic roleplayers, as only English RP realms were made.
- Added back buttons to toggle helmet and cloak display for Classic.
